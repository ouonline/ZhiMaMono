`ZhiMaMono` is a monospace font based on [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka). It only contains visible ASCII characters, resulting in a compact file size, and the character width and margin have been widened (Iosevka appears narrower in comparison).

You can download [ZhiMaMono](ZhiMaMono-Regular.ttf) directly.
